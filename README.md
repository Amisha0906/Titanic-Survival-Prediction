🚀 Approach
EDA: Explored survival patterns by sex, class, age, and embarked location.
Data Cleaning: Filled missing values in Age and Embarked, dropped irrelevant columns.
Feature Engineering: Created new features like FamilySize using sibling count and parents count.
Model Building: Trained a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluation: Achieved ~83% accuracy using cross-validation and tested on the Kaggle test set.
